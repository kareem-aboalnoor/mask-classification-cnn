# Mask Classification Using CNN

This project is my first hands-on deep learning experiment.  
I built a simple **CNN image classifier** that predicts whether a person is **wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask**.  
The model was trained on a labeled dataset and is used in real time through a webcam feed.
