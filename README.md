# Mask Classification Using CNN

This is my **first hands-on deep learning project**!  
I built a simple **CNN image classifier** that predicts whether a person is **wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask**.  
The model was trained on a labeled dataset and can run **real-time detection using a webcam** or on pre-recorded videos.

## 🧩 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Detect mask usage in images or video frames.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Classes:** `Mask` / `No Mask`.
- **Inference:** Real-time predictions with confidence percentages.
- **Display:** Only the text label and confidence percentage appear on the frame:
  - **Green label** = Mask (100%)  
  - **Red label** = No Mask (100%)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains two categories:

- `with_mask`
- `without_mask`
